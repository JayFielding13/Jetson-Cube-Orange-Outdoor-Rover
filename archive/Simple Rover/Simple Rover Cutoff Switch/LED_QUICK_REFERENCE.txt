                    LED BUTTON - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

ILLUMINATED BUTTON WIRING:

  Your 4-pin illuminated button has:
    - 2 pins for the switch (button press detection)
    - 2 pins for the LED (light control)

  Connect to Heltec board:
    Switch Pin 1 → GPIO 47
    Switch Pin 2 → GND
    LED + (positive) → GPIO 48
    LED - (negative) → GND

  Note: GPIO 47 & 48 are safe - they don't conflict with OLED or LoRa!

================================================================================

LED BEHAVIOR:

  ┌────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
  │   ROVER MODE       │   LED STATUS     │
  ├────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
  │   STOP             │   BLINKING       │
  │   (Rover disabled) │   (on/off/on/off)│
  │                    │   500ms interval │
  ├────────────────────┼──────────────────┤
  │   AUTONOMOUS       │   SOLID ON       │
  │   (Rover active)   │   (continuous)   │
  └────────────────────┴──────────────────┘

  Visual meaning:
    Blinking = "Ready and waiting" (safe mode)
    Solid = "Rover is active!" (autonomous mode)

================================================================================

BUTTON OPERATION:

  1. Power on transmitter → LED starts BLINKING (STOP mode)
  2. Press button → LED becomes SOLID (AUTONOMOUS mode)
  3. Press button again → LED starts BLINKING (STOP mode)
  4. Repeat...

================================================================================

CONFIGURATION:

  Button Pin: GPIO 47 (default)
  LED Pin: GPIO 48 (default)

  To change pins:
    - Open: Transmitter/LoRa_KillSwitch_Transmitter_Channel.ino
    - Find line: #define BUTTON_PIN  47
    - Find line: #define LED_PIN     48
    - Change to any available GPIO pins

  Blink Speed: 500ms (default)

  To change blink speed:
    - Open: Transmitter/LoRa_KillSwitch_Transmitter_Channel.ino
    - Find line: #define BLINK_INTERVAL 500
    - Change value (in milliseconds):
        250 = fast blink
        500 = medium blink (default)
        1000 = slow blink

================================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING:

  Problem: LED doesn't light up at all
  Solution:
    ✓ Check LED + wire connected to GPIO 48
    ✓ Check LED - wire connected to GND
    ✓ Verify LED polarity (+ and - correct)
    ✓ Test with multimeter: GPIO 48 should output 3.3V
    ✓ Try swapping LED + and - if button has no markings

  Problem: LED always on, doesn't blink
  Solution:
    ✓ Check Serial Monitor for errors
    ✓ Verify code uploaded successfully
    ✓ Try pressing button to change modes
    ✓ Re-upload code to board

  Problem: LED very dim
  Solution:
    ✓ Check if button needs external resistor
    ✓ Some buttons have 12V LEDs but will work dim at 3.3V
    ✓ Consider using external 5V supply if needed

  Problem: LED blinks but button press doesn't change mode
  Solution:
    ✓ Check switch pins connected to GPIO 47 and GND
    ✓ Watch Serial Monitor when pressing button
    ✓ Try different button or test switch continuity

================================================================================

BUTTON PIN IDENTIFICATION:

Most illuminated buttons have 4 pins arranged like this:

    View from BACK of button:

    ┌─────────────┐
    │  ○       ○  │  ← LED pins
    │             │
    │  ○       ○  │  ← Switch pins
    └─────────────┘

  Use multimeter to identify:
    - Switch pins: Continuity test (beep when pressed)
    - LED pins: Diode test mode (LED glows faintly)

  Common color codes (if wires attached):
    - Switch: Usually thicker wires or different color
    - LED: Usually thinner wires, may be red/black

================================================================================

ALTERNATIVE: Using Just the Switch (No LED)

  If you only want to use the button without LED functionality:

  1. Connect only the switch pins:
     Switch Pin 1 → GPIO 47
     Switch Pin 2 → GND

  2. Leave LED pins disconnected

  3. Code will still work! LED control will be ignored

  4. Use OLED display or Serial Monitor to see mode

                        PIN CONFIGURATION SUMMARY
                    Simple Rover LoRa Cutoff Switch
================================================================================

TRANSMITTER WIRING (Remote Control):
────────────────────────────────────

  Illuminated Button → Heltec Board:

    Button Switch Pin 1  →  GPIO 47
    Button Switch Pin 2  →  GND
    Button LED + (anode) →  GPIO 48
    Button LED - (cathode) → GND

  Why GPIO 47 & 48?
    ✓ Safe to use - no conflicts with OLED or LoRa
    ✓ GPIO 21 is shared with OLED reset - avoid it!
    ✓ These pins have internal pull-up capability


RECEIVER WIRING (On Rover):
────────────────────────────

  Heltec Board → Raspberry Pi:

    USB cable from Heltec to any USB port on Pi
    (This provides both power and serial communication)

  Serial Port on Pi:
    /dev/ttyUSB0  or  /dev/ttyACM0
    Baud rate: 115200


CHANNEL CONFIGURATION:
──────────────────────

  Both boards must have MATCHING sync words!

  Default: 0x12

  To change for multiple rovers:
    Rover 1: 0x12
    Rover 2: 0x34
    Rover 3: 0x56
    etc.


LED BEHAVIOR:
─────────────

  STOP Mode:       LED BLINKS (500ms interval)
  AUTONOMOUS Mode: LED SOLID ON


QUICK TEST:
───────────

  1. Upload code to both boards
  2. Connect button to transmitter (GPIO 47, 48, GND, GND)
  3. Power on both boards
  4. Press button - LED should toggle between blink and solid
  5. Receiver display should show "STOP" or "AUTONOMOUS"


TROUBLESHOOTING:
────────────────

  Button not working?
    → Check GPIO 47 and GND connections
    → Watch Serial Monitor when pressing button

  LED not working?
    → Check GPIO 48 and GND connections
    → Try swapping LED + and - wires

  LoRa not communicating?
    → Check antennas connected to both boards
    → Verify sync words match in both codes

  Pi not seeing serial?
    → Run: ls /dev/ttyUSB* /dev/ttyACM*
    → Try different USB cable or port

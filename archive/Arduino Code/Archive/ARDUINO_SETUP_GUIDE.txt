ARDUINO SETUP GUIDE FOR ROVER PROJECT
===============================================================================

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
- Arduino Nano (or compatible microcontroller)
- FlySky FS-iA10B RC Receiver
- USB cable for programming and communication
- Jumper wires for connections

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
1. PinChangeInterrupt Library
   - Install via Arduino IDE Library Manager
   - Search for "PinChangeInterrupt" by NicoHood
   - Version 1.2.9 or newer recommended

INSTALLATION STEPS:

1. INSTALL ARDUINO IDE:
   - Download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
   - Install Arduino IDE 2.0 or newer

2. INSTALL REQUIRED LIBRARIES:
   - Open Arduino IDE
   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
   - Search for "PinChangeInterrupt"
   - Install "PinChangeInterrupt" by NicoHood

3. BOARD CONFIGURATION:
   - Select Board: Arduino Nano
   - Select Processor: ATmega328P (Old Bootloader) if using clone boards
   - Select Port: COM port where Arduino is connected

4. WIRING CONNECTIONS:
   Pin Connections (Arduino Nano):
   - D2 → RC Receiver CH1 (Forward/Reverse)
   - D3 → RC Receiver CH2 (Steering)  
   - D4 → RC Receiver CH3 (Mode Switch)
   - 5V → RC Receiver VCC
   - GND → RC Receiver GND
   - Built-in LED (Pin 13) used for status indication

5. UPLOAD PROCEDURE:
   - Connect Arduino to computer via USB
   - Open rover_arduino_controller.ino in Arduino IDE
   - Verify code compiles without errors
   - Upload to Arduino Nano

TESTING AND VALIDATION:

1. SERIAL MONITOR TEST:
   - Open Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor)
   - Set baud rate to 115200
   - Power on RC transmitter and receiver
   - Move RC sticks - should see JSON data output:
     {"ch1":xxx,"ch2":xxx,"ch3":xxx,"valid":true,"timestamp":xxxxx}

2. SIGNAL VALIDATION:
   - Status LED should be solid when RC signal is valid
   - Status LED should blink when RC signal is lost
   - Check that all three channels respond to transmitter input

3. VALUE RANGES:
   - CH1/CH2/CH3 values should range from -1000 to +1000
   - Center stick position should read close to 0
   - Deadband eliminates small movements around center

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: Arduino not detected
Solution: Try different USB cable, install CH340/CP2102 drivers for clone boards

Problem: Library not found error
Solution: Install PinChangeInterrupt library via Library Manager

Problem: No RC signal detected
Solution: Check wiring, ensure RC transmitter is bound to receiver

Problem: Inconsistent readings
Solution: Verify power supply is stable, check for loose connections

Problem: Values out of range
Solution: Adjust RC_MIN_PULSE/RC_MAX_PULSE values in code if needed

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:
- Baud Rate: 115200
- Data Format: JSON
- Update Rate: ~100Hz (10ms intervals)
- USB Serial automatically connects when plugged into Raspberry Pi

PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Response Time: <1ms (interrupt-driven)
- Update Rate: 100Hz
- Signal Timeout: 100ms
- Deadband: ±50 units (adjustable)
- Valid PWM Range: 1000-2000 microseconds

POWER REQUIREMENTS:
- Arduino Nano: ~20mA at 5V
- RC Receiver: ~50mA at 5V
- Total: ~70mA (can be powered from Raspberry Pi USB or external 5V supply)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test Arduino code with RC transmitter
2. Verify JSON data output via Serial Monitor
3. Connect to Raspberry Pi via USB
4. Proceed with Raspberry Pi software development

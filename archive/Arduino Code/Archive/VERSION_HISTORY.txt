ARDUINO CODE VERSION HISTORY
===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0 - STABLE BASELINE (rover_arduino_motor_controller_stable_v1)
=======================================================================
Created: December 2024
Status: ✅ STABLE - Tested and working

Features:
- ✅ RC signal processing (CH1, CH2, CH9)
- ✅ Mode switching (Failsafe/Manual/Autonomous)
- ✅ Motor control via pins D5,6,7,9,10,11
- ✅ Bidirectional serial communication with Pi
- ✅ JSON protocol for data exchange
- ✅ Differential steering for RC control
- ✅ Emergency stop on signal loss
- ✅ Status LED indication

Pin Usage:
- D2: CH1 (RC Forward/Reverse)
- D3: CH2 (RC Steering)
- D4: CH9 (RC Mode Switch)
- D5: LEFT_IN1 (Left Motor Direction)
- D6: LEFT_IN2 (Left Motor Direction)
- D7: RIGHT_IN3 (Right Motor Direction)
- D9: LEFT_ENA (Left Motor Speed PWM)
- D10: RIGHT_IN4 (Right Motor Direction)
- D11: RIGHT_ENA (Right Motor Speed PWM)
- D13: Status LED

Available for Future Use:
- D8, D12 (Digital)
- A0-A7 (Analog/Digital)

Test Results:
- ✅ RC signal processing working
- ✅ Motor control working (with direction fix)
- ✅ Mode switching working
- ✅ Serial communication working
- ✅ Differential steering working (with minor clipping at extremes)

Known Issues:
- Minor clipping at extreme RC inputs (workaround: reduce RC range)
- None blocking - system fully functional

VERSION 2.0 - ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT (rover_arduino_enhanced)
=========================================================
Created: December 2024
Status: 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT

Planned Enhancements:
- 🔄 Front ultrasonic sensor (safety/emergency stop)
- 🔄 Rear ultrasonic sensor (safety/emergency stop)
- 🔄 Battery voltage monitoring
- 🔄 Enhanced sensor data reporting
- 🔄 Emergency stop logic based on sensors
- 🔄 Improved status reporting

Planned Pin Additions:
- D8: Front ultrasonic trigger
- D12: Front ultrasonic echo
- A0: Rear ultrasonic trigger
- A1: Rear ultrasonic echo
- A6: Battery voltage (with voltage divider)

Development Notes:
- Base functionality preserved from v1.0
- Adding safety-critical sensors for emergency stop
- Enhanced dashboard integration
- Maintain compatibility with existing Pi code

===============================================================================

USAGE GUIDELINES:
================

STABLE VERSION (v1.0):
- Use for reliable operation
- Proven stable for RC control and basic motor operation
- Recommended for demonstrations and testing

DEVELOPMENT VERSION (v2.0):
- Use for adding new features
- Test thoroughly before deploying
- Can always revert to stable v1.0 if issues arise

BACKUP STRATEGY:
- Always test new features in enhanced version first
- Keep stable version unchanged until new version proven
- Create new stable version only after thorough testing

SIMPLIFIED CONFIDENT AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION
===============================================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
==============
- Eliminated jerky, twitchy movement
- Rover now moves with purpose and confidence
- Clear decision-making process with proper confirmation

NEW APPROACH - "CONFIDENT STRAIGHT-LINE NAVIGATION":
===================================================

PHILOSOPHY:
- Move straight with confidence until absolutely sure there's an obstacle
- Only change direction after proper confirmation
- Prioritize sustained movement over reactive behavior

FOUR-STATE SYSTEM:
=================

1. 🟢 ROAM_STRAIGHT (Default State):
   - Moves forward at cruise speed (180/255)
   - Minimum 3 seconds straight before reacting to anything
   - Only responds to confirmed obstacles or emergency stops
   - Random exploration turns every 15-30 seconds (very infrequent)

2. 🟡 ROAM_SLOWING:
   - Triggered when obstacle detected at 35cm
   - Slows to 80/255 speed while approaching
   - Can resume straight movement if obstacle disappears
   - Transitions to confirming at 20cm

3. 🟠 ROAM_CONFIRMING:
   - Stops completely to confirm obstacle is real
   - Waits 1 second taking sensor readings
   - Requires 3 consecutive obstacle detections for confirmation
   - Either confirms obstacle (→ AVOIDING) or false alarm (→ STRAIGHT)

4. 🔵 ROAM_AVOIDING:
   - Executes confident 2-second turn to avoid obstacle
   - Random left/right direction choice
   - Returns to straight movement after turn complete
   - Also used for random exploration turns

OBSTACLE DETECTION CONFIDENCE:
=============================

THREE-LEVEL DETECTION:
- Emergency Stop: <15cm (immediate reaction)
- Confirmation Zone: <20cm (stop and verify)
- Slow Down Zone: <35cm (reduce speed)

CONFIDENCE FILTERING:
- Tracks last 5 sensor readings
- Requires 3 consecutive detections to confirm obstacle
- Eliminates false positives from sensor noise
- Uses most recent reading for distance display

MOVEMENT PARAMETERS:
===================

SPEEDS:
- Cruise Speed: 180/255 (confident forward movement)
- Slow Speed: 80/255 (cautious approach)
- Turn Speed: 140/255 (decisive avoidance)

TIMINGS:
- Minimum Straight Time: 3 seconds (prevents twitching)
- Confirmation Time: 1 second (verify obstacle)
- Turn Time: 2 seconds (complete avoidance maneuver)
- Random Exploration: 15-30 seconds (infrequent)

DISTANCES:
- Emergency Stop: 15cm (immediate danger)
- Confirm Obstacle: 20cm (verification zone)
- Start Slowing: 35cm (approach zone)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
=================

NORMAL OPERATION:
1. Rover moves straight confidently for extended periods
2. Maintains steady speed and direction
3. Ignores minor sensor variations
4. Only reacts to genuine obstacles

OBSTACLE ENCOUNTER:
1. Detects obstacle at 35cm → starts slowing
2. Continues forward cautiously
3. Stops at 20cm to confirm obstacle is real
4. If confirmed → executes decisive 2-second turn
5. Resumes confident straight movement

FALSE ALARM HANDLING:
1. Starts slowing for suspected obstacle
2. Obstacle disappears → immediately resumes cruise speed
3. Or stops to confirm → no obstacle detected → resumes straight

ADVANTAGES:
==========

CONFIDENT MOVEMENT:
- Long straight-line travel segments
- Sustained speeds without hesitation
- Purposeful direction changes only when necessary

ROBUST OBSTACLE DETECTION:
- Multiple confirmation levels prevent false positives
- Emergency stop for immediate danger
- Graceful degradation through slowing and confirmation

PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR:
- Clear state transitions with obvious purposes
- Easy to debug and understand
- Tunable parameters for different environments

MINIMAL JERKY MOVEMENT:
- Direct motor control (no speed ramping complexity)
- Long minimum durations prevent rapid state changes
- Confident decision-making reduces uncertainty

TESTING EXPECTATIONS:
====================

YOU SHOULD SEE:
- Rover moving in long, straight lines
- Smooth, confident movement at good speed
- Clear reactions to obstacles (slow → stop → confirm → turn)
- Occasional deliberate exploration turns
- No more twitchy, uncertain behavior

DASHBOARD WILL SHOW:
- Mostly "STRAIGHT" state in green
- Brief "SLOWING" in yellow when approaching obstacles
- "CONFIRMING" in orange when stopped to verify
- "AVOIDING" in blue during turns

TUNING OPTIONS:
==============

IF STILL TOO REACTIVE:
- Increase min_straight_time (currently 3000ms)
- Increase consecutive_obstacles requirement (currently 3)
- Increase slow_down_distance (currently 35cm)

IF TOO SLOW TO RESPOND:
- Decrease confirm_time (currently 1000ms)
- Decrease slow_down_distance
- Increase cruise_speed (currently 180/255)

===============================================================================
This simplified approach prioritizes confident, sustained movement over
reactive behavior - exactly what you requested!

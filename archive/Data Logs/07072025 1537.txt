🔬 Starting LiDAR scan debugging...
Purpose: Diagnose why scan distances appear stuck

============================================================
🔬 LIDAR SCAN FRESHNESS DEBUGGER
============================================================
🔌 Connecting to LiDAR...
✅ LiDAR connected and motor started

📊 Testing scan data freshness...
Collecting 10 consecutive scans to check for variations...

🔄 Scan #1:
   Points: 161
   Front min: 152.0cm
   Overall: min=23.7cm, max=443.5cm, avg=111.8cm
   Angle range: 56° to 347°

🔄 Scan #2:
Too many bytes in the input buffer: 4000/3000. Cleaning buffer...
   ❌ Scan 2 failed: Incorrect descriptor starting bytes

🔄 Scan #3:
   ❌ Scan 3 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #4:
   ❌ Scan 4 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #5:
   ❌ Scan 5 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #6:
   ❌ Scan 6 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #7:
   ❌ Scan 7 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #8:
   ❌ Scan 8 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #9:
   ❌ Scan 9 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

🔄 Scan #10:
   ❌ Scan 10 failed: too many values to unpack (expected 2)

📈 ANALYSIS RESULTS:
❌ Insufficient scan data collected

🧹 LiDAR disconnected
